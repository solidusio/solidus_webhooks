<!-- Explain what your extension does. -->

## Installation

Add solidus_webhooks to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'solidus_webhooks'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bin/rails generate solidus_webhooks:install
```

## Usage

<!-- Explain how to use your extension once it's been installed. -->

A Webhook receiver is just a callable and can be registered in the Solidus configuration as follows:

```ruby
SolidusWebhooks.config.register_webhook_handler :tracking_number, -> payload {
  order = Spree::Order.find_by!(number: payload[:order])
  shipment = order.shipments.find_by!(number: payload[:shipment])
  shipment.update!(tracking: payload[:tracking])
}
```

This will enable sending `POST` requests to `/webhooks/tracking-number` with a JSON payload like this:

```json
{
  "order": "R1234567890",
  "shipment": "S1234567890",
  "tracking": "T123-456-789"
}
```

### Handlers requirements

The only requirement on handlers is for them to respond to `#call` and accept a payload.

Example:

```ruby
module TrackingNumberHandler
  def self.call(payload)
    order = Spree::Order.find_by!(number: payload[:order])
    shipment = order.shipments.find_by!(number: payload[:shipment])
    shipment.update!(tracking: payload[:tracking])
  end
end

SolidusWebhooks.config.register_webhook_handler :tracking_number, TrackingNumberHandler
```


### Making the handler asynchronous

To make a handler asynchronous just make its implementation internally call your preferred job handler (e.g. ActiveJob). In most cases you'll want to filter, prepare, and validate the payload for the job of your choice, to avoid ingesting and invalid input.

Example:

```ruby
SolidusWebhooks.config.register_webhook_handler :tracking_number, -> payload {
  UpdateTrackingNumberJob.perform_later(
    order: payload.fetch(:order)
    shipment: payload.fetch(:shipment)
    tracking: payload.fetch(:tracking)
  )
}
```


### Payload routing

If your handler can receive different kind of payloads the most common technique is to route them to appropriate sub-handlers (that can be an ActiveJob class or a service class).

```ruby
SolidusWebhooks.config.register_webhook_handler :tracking_number, -> payload {
  case payload[:tracking]
  when /^FOO(\d+-)+/
    UpdateFooTrackingNumberJob.perform_later(
      order: payload.fetch(:order)
      shipment: payload.fetch(:shipment)
      tracking: payload.fetch(:tracking)
    )
  when /^BAR(\d+-)+/
    UpdateBarTrackingNumberJob.perform_later(
      order: payload.fetch(:order)
      shipment: payload.fetch(:shipment)
      tracking: payload.fetch(:tracking)
    )
  else raise "unknown tracking service"
  end
}
```

### Restricting Permissions

It's good practice not to use admin-user tokens for webhooks, instead you should define a permission set tied to the webhook handler you're providing. Use the standard Solidus permission-sets to do that.

Example:

```ruby
module ReceiveTrackingWebhookPermission < Spree::PermissionSets::Base
  def activate!
    can :receive, Spree::Webhook do |webhook|
      webhook.id == :tracking_number
    end
  end
end

Spree::RoleConfiguration.configure do |config|
  config.assign_permissions :foo_tracking_service, %w[
    ReceiveTrackingWebhookPermission
  ]
end
```

### Accessing the API User

If you need to access the API user that is making the call to the webhook, you can just accept an additional argument in the callable handler.

Example:

```ruby
SolidusWebhooks.config.register_webhook_handler :tracking_number, -> payload, user {
  Rails.logger.info "Received payload from user #{user.email}: #{payload.to_json}"
  # …
}
```

## Development

### Testing the extension

First bundle your dependencies, then run `bin/rake`. `bin/rake` will default to building the dummy
app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using
`bin/rake extension:test_app`.

```shell
bin/rake
```

To run [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) static code analysis run

```shell
bundle exec rubocop
```

When testing your application's integration with this extension you may use its factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'solidus_webhooks/factories'
```

### Running the sandbox

To run this extension in a sandboxed Solidus application, you can run `bin/sandbox`. The path for
the sandbox app is `./sandbox` and `bin/rails` will forward any Rails commands to
`sandbox/bin/rails`.

Here's an example:

```
$ bin/rails server
=> Booting Puma
=> Rails 6.0.2.1 application starting in development
* Listening on tcp://127.0.0.1:3000
Use Ctrl-C to stop
```

### Updating the changelog

Before and after releases the changelog should be updated to reflect the up-to-date status of
the project:

```shell
bin/rake changelog
git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "Update the changelog"
```

### Releasing new versions

Please refer to the dedicated [page](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/wiki/How-to-release-extensions) on Solidus wiki.
